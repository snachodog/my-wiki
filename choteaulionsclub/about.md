# About the Choteau Lions Club
## History of the Choteau Lions Club
The Choteau Lions Club, established in 1927, has been a cornerstone of community service in Choteau, Montana, for nearly a century. Our mission aligns with the core values of Lions Clubs International: to empower volunteers to serve their communities, meet humanitarian needs, encourage peace, and promote international understanding.

Over the years, our club has initiated and supported numerous projects aimed at enhancing the quality of life in Choteau. From organizing local events to participating in global initiatives, we strive to make a positive impact both locally and beyond.

In 2024, we celebrated significant achievements:
- Lion Bob Nauck, a dedicated member, was inducted into the District 37 Hall of Fame at the 2024 District Convention, recognizing his outstanding contributions to our club and the broader Lions community.
- Lion Steve Dogiakos was appointed as the District Cabinet Treasurer for the 2024-2025 Lionistic Year, reflecting his commitment to leadership and service within the organization.

As we approach our centennial anniversary, we remain committed to serving Choteau with the same passion and integrity that have defined our club since its inception.
