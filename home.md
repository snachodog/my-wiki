# Welcome to the Choteau Wiki
Your unofficial guide to life in Choteau, Montana.

Choteau Wiki is a living, community-powered guide to everything and everyone that makes Choteau work. Whether you're new in town, raising a family, running a business, volunteering, or just trying to figure out where to take your recycling, this is the place to start.

### Think of it as a practical "how-to" for Choteau life:

- **How to join local clubs or service organizations** like Lions, Soroptimists, or 4-H.
- **Where to find local resources** like public meeting schedules, city services, library programs, or volunteer opportunities.
- **Who to talk to when you need to get something done**—whether it’s a zoning question, event permit, or community cleanup.

But that’s just the beginning.

### This wiki could grow to include:
- Profiles of local landmarks and businesses (especially ones not well-documented elsewhere).
- Historical information about Choteau's neighborhoods, schools, and civic life.
- Local government basics explained in plain language—how to attend meetings, submit comments, or navigate permits.
- Guides for newcomers: Where to shop, eat, get internet, or register to vote.
- Tips from locals: Where to sled in the winter, fish in the summer, or see the best Christmas lights.

### We aim to make this wiki:
- Collaborative: Anyone in the community can contribute or request updates.
- Practical: Focused on what’s useful, not just what’s official.
- Ever-evolving: It’ll grow as the town grows, as new neighbors arrive, and as old-timers share their knowledge.
