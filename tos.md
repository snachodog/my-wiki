Welcome to **[Choteau Wiki](https://choteau.wiki)**. By using this site, you agree to the following terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the site.

This wiki is a community-maintained, non-official guide to life in Choteau, Montana. It is operated by local volunteers to share useful information, promote civic engagement, and support neighborly cooperation.

## 1. Community Standards

Choteau Wiki is built on respect. We expect all users to:

- Make personal attacks or threats
- Upload hateful, obscene, or illegal content
- Impersonate another person or organization
- Attempt to compromise or disrupt the website

We have **zero tolerance** for doxxing or personal harassment. This includes sharing private contact details, locations, or information that could reasonably identify a private individual without their consent.

Violators will be **permanently banned** and may be reported to authorities if appropriate.

## 3. Contributions & Moderation

Content you post (including pages, edits, or comments):

- Must be your own or openly licensed

- Limit features or block access to disruptive users

We are not required to notify you before taking moderation action.

## 4. Copyright & Licensing

Unless otherwise stated, all original contributions to this site are released under a **Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 License (CC BY-SA 4.0)**. You are free to share and adapt the content with proper credit and under the same license.

You must not upload copyrighted content without permission.

## 5. Use at Your Own Risk

While we aim to keep content accurate and up to date, Choteau Wiki makes **no guarantees** about the correctness, completeness, or reliability of any information provided.

Use the information on this site **at your own risk**. Always verify important details with official sources or authorities.

## 6. Termination of Access

We may suspend or permanently ban accounts that violate these terms. Severe violations (such as doxxing, hate speech, or repeated vandalism) may result in **immediate and permanent bans** without warning.

## 7. Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms of Service from time to time. If we do, we’ll post the updated version on this page with a revised “Last updated” date. Continued use of the site means you accept the revised terms.
